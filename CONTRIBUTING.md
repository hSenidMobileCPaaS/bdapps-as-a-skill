# Contributing

This skill is proprietary software owned by hSenid Mobile Solutions (Pvt) Ltd. See
[LICENSE](LICENSE).

**External pull requests and forks are not accepted.** The licence does not permit modifying
or redistributing the skill, so there is no contribution path that would be lawful to merge
from outside hSenid Mobile.

That does not mean feedback is unwelcome — it is the most valuable thing you can send.

## What to report

Open an issue. Accuracy reports are the highest-value contribution, because a wrong parameter
name in this skill becomes a wrong parameter name in someone's production integration.

- **The API contract has changed** — a parameter that is now required, a new enum value, a
  changed endpoint. Include the docs page or the observed response.
- **A status code** you have seen that is not in the table.
- **Per-operator differences** between Robi and Airtel Bangladesh.
- **Bad guidance** — the skill led an agent to write incorrect, insecure or non-compliant code.
- **Agent support** — a platform that should load the skill but does not.
- **New services**, as bdapps publishes them.

Anything factual needs a source: a link to <https://dev.bdapps.com>, or a real
request/response pair with credentials and MSISDNs redacted.

## Never include in an issue

- A real `applicationId` or `password`. If you have already pasted one anywhere, rotate it in
  the portal first — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- A real subscriber MSISDN. Use `tel:8801812345678`.
- Anything copied from a production log.

## For hSenid Mobile maintainers

The catalog is the source of truth. `catalog/bdapps-api.json` drives the CLI, the curl
reference, the tests and much of the documentation. When a contract changes:

1. Edit `catalog/bdapps-api.json`.
2. Run `node scripts/build-curl-reference.mjs` to regenerate
   `references/13-curl-reference.md`.
3. Update the matching `references/*.md` so prose and data agree.
4. Run `npm test` — the suite checks that every referenced status code exists, every parameter
   is fully specified, every documented sample validates against its own schema, every callback
   has fields and a sample payload, every referenced file is present, and every endpoint,
   parameter and response field appears in the curl reference.

`references/13-curl-reference.md` is generated from the catalog and carries a banner saying so;
`scripts/build-curl-reference.mjs --check` fails the build if it drifts. Never hand-edit it —
fix the catalog or the builder.

**This repo ships no code generator, and should not grow one.** It had emitters for six
languages once; they were removed because an emitter encodes language idiom rather than the
bdapps contract, so it ages with six ecosystems while the contract barely moves — and it makes
every seventh language second-class. The curl reference is the delivery mechanism for an
implementation now, in every language equally. If a request for "a Kotlin client" arrives, the
answer is a correct contract plus the seven components in `references/11-any-stack.md`, not a
seventh emitter.

**bdappsAI lives in its own catalog branch** (`catalog.bdappsai`), not in `catalog.services`, and
that separation is load-bearing. It authenticates with a header rather than body credentials,
returns real HTTP status codes rather than the `S1000` envelope, has no subscriber and no
callbacks — so the telco invariants the tests enforce (`applicationId` and `password` required,
`tel:` addressing, `statusCode` branching) are wrong for it. Appending a bdappsAI endpoint to
`catalog.services` to "keep them together" would make every one of those invariants either fail
or, worse, silently apply. Its errors are in `catalog.bdappsai.errors`, keyed by HTTP status and
by the code that arrives in `error.code`; `lookupBdappsAiError` reads them, and it deliberately will
not resolve a telco `E13xx`.

Where the official documentation and a verified working call disagree, the catalog records the
call that works, with no caveat in the text. The skill gives one answer; a hedge in a parameter
description is a bug.

Agent rule files are generated. `AGENTS.md` is the single source; the Cursor, Windsurf, Cline,
Kiro, Qoder, Copilot and `.agents` copies come from it:

```bash
node scripts/sync-rules.mjs          # regenerate
node scripts/sync-rules.mjs --check  # CI check
```

Edit `AGENTS.md`, never a generated copy. CI fails if they drift.

Templates are per-language ports of one specification. Adding a language means: a directory
under `templates/` with config, client and callback handlers; the same `BDAPPS_*` variable
names as every other port; a row in `templates/README.md` and in the shipped-templates table in
`references/11-any-stack.md`; and an entry in `TEMPLATE_LANGUAGES` in
`tests/packaging.test.js`, which enforces all of the above. bdapps is JSON over HTTPS — no
guidance in this repo may assume a particular runtime.

Before pushing:

```bash
npm test                                       # catalog, tooling and packaging tests
node scripts/sync-rules.mjs --check            # rule copies in sync
node scripts/build-curl-reference.mjs --check  # curl reference in sync with the catalog
bash -n scripts/*.sh                           # shell scripts parse
node tools/bdapps.mjs list                   # CLI still works
```

Or `npm run check`, which runs both sync checks and the tests.

### Style

- Write for someone integrating at 2am with a failing call. Lead with what to do.
- State the consequence, not just the rule — "never retry with a new `externalTrxId`" lands
  because the next clause says it double-charges a real person.
- When the official documentation is inconsistent, say so and tell the reader to handle both
  cases. Do not silently pick one.
- No invented endpoints, parameters or status codes. If it is not documented or observed, say
  it is not documented.
