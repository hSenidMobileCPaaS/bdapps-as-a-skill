# Status Codes

## The single most important rule

**bdapps returns HTTP 200 for application-level failures.** The real outcome is the
`statusCode` field in the response body.

```
# WRONG — reports failures as successes
response = http_post(url, body)
if response.ok: return "sent"

# RIGHT
response = http_post(url, body)
data = parse_json(response.body)
if data.statusCode != "S1000":
    raise BdappsError(data.statusCode, data.statusDetail)
```

Every stack spells the wrong version differently — `res.ok`, `raise_for_status()`,
`EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`, `response.IsSuccessStatusCode`, Guzzle's `http_errors`,
`resp.StatusCode == 200`. All of them are the same bug.

Every response carries `statusCode` and `statusDetail`. Codes starting `S` are success;
codes starting `E` are errors.

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `S1000` | Success |
| `E13xx` | Application, authentication, routing, delivery, charging errors |
| `E14xx` | Card / NFC / charging authorisation errors |
| `E16xx` | Platform-side system errors |
| `E18xx` | OTP and unsupported-operation errors |

## Handling classes

Map codes to behaviour, not to strings. Four classes drive four different actions:

| Class | Retry? | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **Configuration** | **Never** | Your provisioning or credentials are wrong. Code changes will not help. Fix the portal. |
| **Client** | **Never** | Your payload is wrong, or the user gave bad input. Fix the request or prompt the user. |
| **User state** | **Only after user action** | The user is not eligible right now. Communicate, do not retry in a loop. |
| **Transient** | **Yes, backoff** | Platform-side. Exponential backoff with jitter, capped attempts, then dead-letter. |

Every published code carries its class in the [complete list](#complete-official-error-code-list)
below — build your sets from that column, not from a remembered range. `E1308`, for instance,
sits among configuration-class neighbours but is client-class.

Special cases that look like errors but are not:

- **`E1351` "User already registered"** on Register → the desired state already holds. Success.
- **`E1356` "User not registered"** on Unregister → the desired state already holds. Success.
- **`E1379` "Transaction has already completed"** on a debit retry → your idempotency key
  worked. Success. Do **not** charge again.

## Codes you will actually hit, and what to do

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `S1000` | Success | Proceed |
| `E1303` | **Source IP not in allowed-host-address list** | Run `curl -4 https://api.ipify.org` on the calling server; add that IP in the portal |
| `E1309` | Requested service is not allowed for this application | The API was not provisioned. Portal fix, not a code fix. |
| `E1313` | **Authentication failure** — no active application, no active SP, or wrong password | Check `BDAPPS_APP_ID` / `BDAPPS_PASSWORD`; check the app is active |
| `E1317` | MSISDN is in an invalid state (blocked, or wrong digit length) | Validate the number; do not retry |
| `E1325` | Format of the address is invalid | Missing `tel:` prefix, or a `+`/space slipped in |
| `E1331` | Invalid/unauthorised source address | `sourceAddress` is not a provisioned alias |
| `E1334` / `E1335` | Message too long (normal / advertisement) | Shorten or split |
| `E1351` | User already registered | Treat as success on Register |
| `E1356` | User not registered | Treat as success on Unregister; on send, stop messaging them |
| `E1367` | Requested QoS not supported | You asked above your provisioned level |
| `E1378` | **Insufficient balance** | Tell the user; retry later, not immediately |
| `E1379` | Transaction already completed | Treat as success |
| `E1850`–`E1853` | OTP invalid / expired / attempts exceeded | Prompt the user; enforce the 3-attempt, 60-minute limits yourself too |

## Complete official error code list

Reproduced from <https://dev.bdapps.com/API_Documentation/bdapps_tap_api.html>. `{0}` is a
placeholder the platform fills in. The **Class** column is the one to build your error handling
from: it maps each code to one of the four behaviours above, and it is the same classification
`node tools/bdapps.mjs code <statusCode>` returns and
[`catalog/bdapps-api.json`](../catalog/bdapps-api.json) stores.

## Reference implementation

Whatever your language calls an error — exception, error struct, result variant — it needs the
code, the detail, and two questions answerable from the sets below:

```
TRANSIENT = { E1316, E1318, E1319, E1332, E1341,
              E1360, E1363, E1364, E1600, E1601, E1602, E1603 }

CONFIGURATION = { E1301, E1302, E1303, E1304, E1305, E1306, E1307,
                  E1309, E1310, E1311, E1313, E1315, E1322, E1323,
                  E1324, E1327, E1328, E1329, E1336, E1371, E1381,
                  E1383, E1387 }

# Codes that mean "the outcome you wanted already holds".
BENIGN = { register: E1351, unregister: E1356, debit: E1379 }

error BdappsError(statusCode, statusDetail, service):
    retryable       = statusCode in TRANSIENT
    isConfiguration = statusCode in CONFIGURATION
```

These sets are also machine-readable in
[`catalog/bdapps-api.json`](../catalog/bdapps-api.json) under `statusCodes` (each code
carries its `class`), so you can generate them rather than retyping them.

Working versions: [templates/](../templates/README.md) — TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, PHP and
C# all express exactly this.

Alerting rule of thumb: any **configuration**-class code in production is a page — the whole
integration is down, not one request. Transient codes belong on a rate dashboard.
