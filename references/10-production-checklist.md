# Production Checklist

Work through this before requesting full production approval. Each item has cost a service
provider something real.

## Credentials and configuration

- [ ] No `applicationId` or `password` anywhere in source, tests, fixtures, or git history
- [ ] `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` contains **only placeholders**
- [ ] Secrets stored in the host's secret manager, not in plaintext config
- [ ] Separate credentials for development and production
- [ ] Startup validation fails loudly on any missing variable
- [ ] No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` / `VITE_` / `REACT_APP_` prefix on any bdapps variable
- [ ] Base URL and endpoint paths read from config, not inlined
- [ ] Secret scanning enabled in CI
- [ ] Credential rotation procedure written down and tested at least once

## Network

- [ ] Production egress IP confirmed with `curl -4 https://api.ipify.org` **on the
      production server**
- [ ] That IP added to *Allowed Host Addresses* in the portal
- [ ] Egress IP is static and will survive scaling, redeploys, and restarts
- [ ] Callback URLs are HTTPS with a valid, complete certificate chain
- [ ] Callback URLs are stable — not a preview or tunnel URL
- [ ] Callback endpoints restricted to bdapps source IPs
- [ ] Callback endpoints exempt from CSRF and auth middleware, but IP-restricted
- [ ] Bot protection / WAF does not challenge the callback paths
- [ ] TLS verification is **on**; any chain problem solved with an explicit CA bundle, not by
      disabling validation

## Correctness

- [ ] All responses branch on `statusCode`, never on the HTTP status alone
- [ ] `E1351` on Register treated as success
- [ ] `E1356` on Unregister treated as success
- [ ] `E1379` on debit treated as success
- [ ] All subscriber addresses normalised through one `tel:` helper
- [ ] `destinationAddresses` is always an array
- [ ] `subscriberId` treated as opaque — masking-safe
- [ ] USSD `sessionId` echoed, never regenerated
- [ ] USSD sessions terminated with `mt-fin`
- [ ] USSD session store is shared across instances (not an in-process `Map`) and has a TTL
- [ ] USSD screens are plain ASCII and under ~160 characters
- [ ] Explicit timeout on every outbound call
- [ ] Retries only on transport errors and transient codes, with backoff and a cap

## Callbacks

- [ ] All four relevant callbacks implemented: MO SMS, delivery report, USSD, subscription
      notification
- [ ] Every handler returns `{"statusCode":"S1000","statusDetail":"Success"}`
- [ ] Every handler acknowledges **before** doing real work
- [ ] Every handler is idempotent, with a dedupe key
- [ ] Every handler validates the payload schema
- [ ] Every handler verifies `applicationId` matches
- [ ] Malformed payloads acknowledged and discarded, not 500'd
- [ ] Duplicate-delivery test exists and passes

## Charging (if using CaaS)

- [ ] `externalTrxId` unique and persisted **before** the API call
- [ ] Transaction row written before the call, updated after
- [ ] Retries reuse the same `externalTrxId`
- [ ] `E1406` (user rejected) never retried
- [ ] Timeouts resolved by re-calling with the **same** `externalTrxId`, never with a new one
- [ ] `internalTrxId` stored for support
- [ ] Amounts use a decimal type
- [ ] Amount and currency sourced server-side, never from client input
- [ ] Charged amount matches exactly what was disclosed before subscription
- [ ] Balance query gated off unless "Enable Query Balance Requests" is provisioned
- [ ] `paymentInstrumentName: "MobileAccount"` sent on every debit and balance query
- [ ] Currency is `BDT` everywhere; no other currency is accepted
- [ ] Reconciliation job compares your ledger against the platform's transaction report

## Subscription Charging SDK (if using the hosted consent page)

- [ ] `BDAPPS_SDK_API_KEY` and `BDAPPS_SDK_API_SECRET` come from the environment, never source
- [ ] The signature is computed **server-side** — never in browser JavaScript
- [ ] `requestTime` is generated once and used identically in the signature and the query string
- [ ] Every parameter is URL-encoded, `redirectUrl` included
- [ ] `requestId` is unique, persisted **before** the redirect, and consumed exactly once
- [ ] The return handler matches `requestId` and then confirms with `POST /subscription/getStatus`
- [ ] `redirectUrl` is HTTPS, controlled by you, and never built from user input
- [ ] Consent evidence recorded on return: timestamp, `requestId`, wording shown

## Consent and compliance

- [ ] Explicit opt-in captured before every Register
- [ ] Charge amount, currency and frequency disclosed before subscribing
- [ ] Consent evidence stored: user, timestamp, channel, wording shown
- [ ] Opt-out available in every channel the user can reach
- [ ] `STOP` / `UNSUB` / `OFF` handled in MO SMS
- [ ] Opt-out stops queued and scheduled messages, not just new ones
- [ ] Opted-out users are never re-subscribed without fresh consent
- [ ] `tel:all` broadcast behind a deliberate, separately-authorised path
- [ ] Broadcast volume sanity-checked against Query Base before sending

## Privacy

- [ ] Number masking enabled if the real MSISDN is not needed
- [ ] `subscriberId` masked in all logs
- [ ] Message bodies not logged, or logged with a stated reason and retention period
- [ ] OTP, `referenceNo` and password never logged
- [ ] MSISDNs encrypted at rest if stored
- [ ] Retention policy defined and enforced
- [ ] Subscriber data deleted or anonymised on unsubscribe

## Operations

- [ ] `requestId` / `sessionId` / `externalTrxId` / `statusCode` logged on every operation
- [ ] Alert on configuration-class errors (`E1303`, `E1313`, `E1309`) — the integration is down
- [ ] Dashboard for send volume, delivery rate, charge success rate, base size
- [ ] Query Base polled on a schedule into metrics, not per request
- [ ] Dead-letter queue for failed callback processing
- [ ] Operator TPS/TPD limits known and respected by a throttle
- [ ] Runbook: what to do on `E1303`, on `E1313`, on a charging dispute
- [ ] Someone owns the bdapps account and can log in to rotate credentials

## Testing

- [ ] Every endpoint smoke-tested against Limited Production with whitelisted numbers
- [ ] Full end-to-end tested: register → receive SMS → USSD session → charge → unregister
- [ ] Opt-out path tested end to end
- [ ] Callback handlers tested with valid, malformed, wrong-app, and duplicate payloads
- [ ] Failure paths tested: `E1313`, `E1303`, `E1378`, timeout
- [ ] Load tested to the operator TPS ceiling
- [ ] Tested from the production egress IP, not from a laptop

## Before requesting approval

- [ ] Application description in the portal accurately states what the app does
- [ ] Charging amounts are defensible — obviously unfair rates are questioned before approval
- [ ] Terms of service and privacy policy exist and are reachable by users
- [ ] Support contact published to end users
- [ ] Limited Production testing completed with whitelisted numbers
- [ ] Content governance and advertisement settings match expectations

## Common failure signatures

| Symptom | Almost always |
|---|---|
| Everything returns `E1303` | Calling from an IP not on the whitelist — a laptop, a CI runner, or a serverless function with rotating egress |
| Everything returns `E1313` | Wrong credentials, wrong environment's credentials, or the app is not active |
| One API returns `E1309`, others work | That API was not provisioned |
| Test number gets nothing, no errors | Number not in *Whitelisted Numbers* while in Limited Production |
| USSD session dies mid-flow | Session store not shared across instances, no `mt-fin`, or a slow handler |
| Callbacks never arrive | URL not publicly reachable, wrong URL in the portal, WAF challenge, or an auth middleware in front |
| Duplicate charges | Retrying with a fresh `externalTrxId` after a timeout |
| Works locally, fails deployed | Egress IP changed, or secrets not set in the host's environment |
