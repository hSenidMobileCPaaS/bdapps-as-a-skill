# Implementing in Any Stack

bdapps is JSON over HTTPS with a shared-secret credential pair. **Nothing about it requires
a particular language, framework or runtime.** Any stack that can make an HTTPS POST and serve
an HTTPS POST endpoint can run a complete, production-grade integration.

This document is the language-neutral specification. Build the seven components below in
whatever the host project already uses. The files in [templates/](../templates/) are the same
seven components written out in several languages — read the one closest to your stack, but
treat *this* page as the contract.

**The calls themselves are in [13-curl-reference.md](13-curl-reference.md)** — every endpoint as
a runnable curl, with every parameter defined, the response, and every response field explained,
plus all four callbacks. That page and this one are together a complete integration in a
language nobody here has written a template for: it gives you the wire, this gives you what
surrounds it.

> Rule of thumb: **match the host project.** A Django codebase gets Python, a Spring service
> gets Java, a Laravel app gets PHP. Introducing a second runtime "because the sample was in
> TypeScript" is a worse outcome than any template mismatch.

## The seven components

Every correct integration, in every language, is these seven things. Nothing more is required
and nothing here is optional.

| # | Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Config module** | The only place that reads the environment. Validates at startup, fails loudly, exposes one URL per provisioned service. |
| 2 | **Address normaliser** | The only place `tel:` is added. One function, applied at the boundary. |
| 3 | **Transport helper** | One `post(service, url, body)`: injects credentials, sets a timeout, parses JSON, branches on `statusCode`, raises a typed error. |
| 4 | **Status-code classifier** | Maps a code to one of four classes — configuration, client, user-state, transient — plus the benign codes per operation. |
| 5 | **Service wrappers** | One thin function per API (`sendSms`, `register`, `debit`, …). No call site builds a payload itself. |
| 6 | **Callback endpoints** | Five HTTPS POST routes that acknowledge with `S1000` first and process out of band. |
| 7 | **State stores** | A USSD session store (shared, TTL ~2 min) and an idempotency store for `externalTrxId`. Both must survive a restart and work across instances. |

If your port has all seven and passes the [acceptance checklist](#acceptance-checklist-for-a-port),
it is as correct as any other language's version.

---

## 1. Config

```
BDAPPS_APP_ID          required — fail to start without it
BDAPPS_PASSWORD        required — fail to start without it
BDAPPS_<SERVICE>_URL   optional — absent means "not provisioned, refuse to call"
```

Requirements, in any language:

- One module owns environment access. Nothing else reads it — not a controller, not a job.
- Validation runs **at startup**, not at first use. A missing credential must stop the process
  from accepting traffic, not surface as `E1313` at 3am.
- Resolving an unset endpoint raises a local error naming the missing variable. That is the
  guard that turns "the API was never provisioned" into a clear boot-time message instead of
  `E1309` from the platform.
- A redacted `describeConfig()`-style dump is worth having: application id, `***redacted***`
  for the password, and the list of enabled services.

The variable names are fixed across every language — see
[templates/.env.example](../templates/.env.example). Keep them identical so a polyglot estate
has one deployment story.

## 2. Address normalisation

```
input                        output
tel:8801812345678          →   tel:8801812345678     (already prefixed — return unchanged)
tel:hu3b84346f…          →   tel:hu3b84346f…     (masked hash — opaque, never parse)
+880 18 1234 5678          →   tel:8801812345678
008801812345678            →   tel:8801812345678
018 1234 5678             →   tel:8801812345678     (local form → country code)
""                       →   error
```

One function. Never concatenate `tel:` at a call site. A separate `maskAddress()` for logging
that keeps the first three and last three characters and stars the middle.

## 3. The transport helper

The whole platform is one request shape, so it is one function:

```
function post(service, url, body, benignCodes = []):
    payload = { applicationId: config.appId, password: config.password } merged with body
    response = HTTP POST url
                 header Content-Type: application/json
                 body   json(payload)
                 timeout 15 seconds            # never unbounded
    data = json(response.body)                 # non-JSON body is a transport error

    if data.statusCode == "S1000":      return data
    if data.statusCode in benignCodes:  return data
    raise BdappsError(data.statusCode, data.statusDetail, service, data)
```

Three things this pseudocode says that are easy to get wrong in a port:

- **The HTTP status is never consulted.** bdapps returns 200 for application-level failures.
  If your HTTP library raises on non-2xx, that is fine — but success is decided by
  `statusCode` alone.
- **The timeout is a constant, not configuration.** It is a property of the protocol.
- **Credentials are injected here, once.** No wrapper accepts them as an argument, so no call
  site can pass the wrong ones or log them.

## 4. Status-code classification

The four classes and their members are in [08-status-codes.md](08-status-codes.md) and, as
machine-readable data, in [`catalog/bdapps-api.json`](../catalog/bdapps-api.json) under
`statusCodes` — generate the sets from the catalog rather than retyping them.

The error type your language uses (exception, error struct, result variant) needs three
things: the code, the detail, and a way to ask `retryable?` and `configuration?`.

Benign codes, per operation:

| Operation | Benign code | Means |
|---|---|---|
| Register | `E1351` | Already registered — the desired state holds |
| Unregister | `E1356` | Not registered — the desired state holds |
| Direct debit | `E1379` | Transaction already completed — **do not charge again** |

## 5. Service wrappers

One function per API, each a single `post()` call. Two carry extra local guards regardless of
language:

- **Broadcast** (`tel:all`) lives in its own function with an explicit confirmation argument,
  so it can never be reached by an ordinary code path.
- **Debit** validates that `externalTrxId` is present and ≤ 32 characters, and never retries
  internally. A timeout does not mean the charge failed.

## 6. Callback endpoints

Five routes, one contract: respond HTTP 200 with
`{"statusCode":"S1000","statusDetail":"Success"}`, immediately, before doing any work. Full
rules in [07-callbacks.md](07-callbacks.md).

"Process out of band" means different things per stack, and picking the wrong one is the most
common porting mistake:

| Stack | Acknowledge-first mechanism |
|---|---|
| Node / TypeScript | Push to a queue, return the response; never `await` the work |
| Python (FastAPI/Django) | `BackgroundTasks`, Celery, RQ, or a thread pool — **not** a bare `await` |
| Java (Spring) | `@Async` method, or hand off to an `ExecutorService` / message broker |
| Go | Send to a buffered channel consumed by a worker goroutine (bounded, not a bare `go func`) |
| PHP | Queue the payload (Laravel queues, Redis list, database table) — PHP-FPM has no "after response" worker of its own |
| .NET | `IHostedService` + `Channel<T>`, or a background queue |
| Serverless | Write to SQS/PubSub and return; do not do the work in the request lifetime |

The USSD timeout is measured in seconds. Anything that does a database write chain or an
outbound HTTP call before responding will lose sessions in production.

## 7. State stores

| Store | Key | TTL | Must survive |
|---|---|---|---|
| USSD session | `sessionId` | ~2 minutes | Restart, deploy, and routing to another instance |
| Charge idempotency | `externalTrxId` | Until reconciled | Everything — this one prevents double-charging |
| Callback dedupe | the documented key per callback | Hours | Redelivery |

An in-process map or dictionary is a development convenience in **every** language. Redis,
Memcached with persistence, or a database table are the production answers. The failure mode
is identical whether the map is a JS `Map`, a Python `dict`, a Go `map`, or a static
`HashMap` — the second instance cannot see it and the user's menu dies mid-flow.

## Per-language notes

The parts that genuinely differ between stacks, and the answer for each.

| Concern | Node / TS | Python | Java | Go | PHP | .NET |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP client | `https` / `fetch` / undici | `urllib.request`, `httpx`, `requests` | `java.net.http.HttpClient` | `net/http` | cURL extension, Guzzle | `HttpClient` (via `IHttpClientFactory`) |
| JSON | built in | `json` | Jackson / Gson | `encoding/json` | `json_encode` / `json_decode` | `System.Text.Json` |
| Env loading | `process.env` (+ dotenv in dev) | `os.environ` (+ python-dotenv) | `System.getenv` / Spring `@Value` | `os.Getenv` | `getenv` / `$_ENV` | `IConfiguration` + `IOptions<T>` |
| Startup validation | throw at module load | raise in a module-level factory | fail fast in a `@PostConstruct` / bean init | `panic` in `init()`/`LoadConfig` | throw in the container binding | `ValidateOnStart()` |
| Money | **not** `number` — decimal string or a decimal library | `decimal.Decimal` | `BigDecimal` | `shopspring/decimal` or minor-unit ints | `bcmath` / string | `decimal` |
| Schema validation of callbacks | zod / valibot | pydantic | Bean Validation / Jackson strict binding | struct tags + explicit checks | manual guards or a validator | data annotations / `System.Text.Json` strict |
| TLS chain fix | `https.Agent({ ca })` | `ssl.create_default_context(cafile=…)` | `KeyStore` / `SSLContext`, or `keytool -importcert` | `x509.CertPool` + `tls.Config.RootCAs` | `CURLOPT_CAINFO` | `SocketsHttpHandler` + custom root store |
| Never do this | `rejectUnauthorized: false`, `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` | `verify=False` | trust-all `TrustManager` | `InsecureSkipVerify: true` | `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER=0` | callback returning `true` unconditionally |

**Client-side prefixes to never use on a bdapps variable**, since every framework has one:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, `PUBLIC_` (SvelteKit), `EXPO_PUBLIC_`,
`NG_` build-time replacements, `@Value` injected into a browser-served config endpoint. They
all publish the password to the browser.

### Runtimes that need a decision before you build

- **Serverless functions** (Lambda, Cloud Run, Vercel, Azure Functions) have rotating egress
  IPs, and bdapps enforces IP whitelisting (`E1303`). Route through a NAT gateway with a
  fixed IP, a static-IP proxy, or a small always-on service. This is a hosting decision, not a
  code one, and retrofitting it is painful.
- **Edge runtimes** (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge) additionally give you no
  control over egress IP at all. Do not put bdapps calls there.
- **Mobile and desktop clients** never call bdapps directly, in any language. They call your
  backend.
- **Short-lived CLI or cron processes** are fine, provided they run on a whitelisted host and
  read credentials from the environment rather than a config file in the repo.

## Acceptance checklist for a port

A port in a language with no template is done when all of these hold. Check them against the
code, not against intent.

1. Exactly one module reads the environment, and the process refuses to start with
   `BDAPPS_APP_ID` or `BDAPPS_PASSWORD` missing.
2. Calling a service whose URL variable is unset raises a local error naming the variable —
   no request leaves the process.
3. Exactly one function produces a `tel:` address; a grep for `"tel:"` finds it and nothing
   else.
4. Success is decided by `statusCode == "S1000"`, never by the HTTP status.
5. `E1351` on register, `E1356` on unregister and `E1379` on debit return successfully.
6. Every outbound call has an explicit timeout.
7. Retries cover transport errors and transient codes only, with backoff — and the debit path
   has no automatic retry at all.
8. `externalTrxId` is generated and persisted **before** the debit call, and reused unchanged
   on any resolution attempt.
9. All four callback routes return `{"statusCode":"S1000","statusDetail":"Success"}` with
   HTTP 200 for valid, malformed, wrong-application and duplicate payloads alike.
10. Callback work happens after the response, through the stack's real background mechanism.
11. The USSD session store is shared across instances and expires entries.
12. Logs contain `requestId` / `sessionId` / `externalTrxId` / `statusCode`, and never a
    password, an OTP, a `referenceNo`, or an unmasked subscriber address.
13. TLS verification is on, with the intermediate CA supplied if the handshake needs it.

Verify 1–8 by reading the code; verify 9–11 with
[scripts/test-callbacks.sh](../scripts/test-callbacks.sh), which is plain curl and works
against a handler in any language. Verify the whole outbound path with
[scripts/smoke-test.sh](../scripts/smoke-test.sh) (or `smoke-test.ps1`).

## Shipped templates

| Directory | Contents | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [templates/typescript/](../templates/typescript/) | config, client, types, Next.js callback routes, USSD session store + menu tree | The most complete set; read it for the full commentary |
| [templates/python/](../templates/python/) | config, client, FastAPI callback routes, USSD session store | Standard library only; `httpx`/`requests` notes inline |
| [templates/java/](../templates/java/) | config, client, Spring callback controller | Java 17 `HttpClient`, Jackson |
| [templates/go/](../templates/go/) | config, client, callback handlers | Standard library only |
| [templates/php/](../templates/php/) | config, client, callback front controller | cURL extension; Laravel notes inline |
| [templates/csharp/](../templates/csharp/) | options, typed client, ASP.NET Core callback endpoints | `IHttpClientFactory`, `System.Text.Json` |

No template for your stack — Ruby, Rust, Kotlin, Elixir, Scala, Dart on a server? Take the
calls from [13-curl-reference.md](13-curl-reference.md), implement the seven components above
around them, use the closest template for the shape, and run the acceptance checklist. The
contract also ships as [`catalog/bdapps-api.json`](../catalog/bdapps-api.json), plain JSON
that every language can read directly.

---

## Tooling versus stack

`tools/bdapps.mjs` runs on Node. That is a property of the *documentation tool*, not of your
integration — it makes no network calls and never sees a credential. If Node is not available on
your machine, nothing is lost: [13-curl-reference.md](13-curl-reference.md) is the same contract
as prose, and the underlying data is in
[`catalog/bdapps-api.json`](../catalog/bdapps-api.json):

```bash
jq '.services[] | select(.id=="caas-direct-debit")' catalog/bdapps-api.json
python -c "import json;print(json.load(open('catalog/bdapps-api.json'))['statusCodes']['E1303'])"
```

Same contract, no runtime required.
