bdapps is Robi Axiata's telco platform for **Bangladesh**, covering the operators Robi
(018, 016) and Airtel Bangladesh (016). It exposes SMS, USSD, subscription management, OTP
verification and mobile-account charging as JSON-over-HTTPS APIs, served from
`https://developer.bdapps.com`. The middleware behind them is called **TAP**, which is why
`requestId` is documented as "uniquely identifies a request within TAP".

bdapps also runs **bdappsAI**, an AI gateway: one OpenAI-shaped API in front of Claude, Gemini
and GPT models, plus image generation, billed from a bdapps token balance. It shares the
brand and the host and almost nothing else, so it has its own section at the end of this file
and its own reference, [references/14-bdapps-ai.md](references/14-bdapps-ai.md). **Do not apply the
telco rules below to a bdappsAI call, or the bdappsAI rules to a telco one.**

**Apply these instructions whenever the work involves bdapps, bdapps Pro, `developer.bdapps.com`,
`tel:` MSISDN addressing, USSD menus, shortcode/keyword routing, subscriber base size,
direct carrier billing, telco SMS in Bangladesh, or bdappsAI / `developer.bdapps.com/bdappsai`.**

The platform is JSON over HTTPS, so **any language builds a complete integration** — write it
in whatever the host project already uses. Every endpoint is written out as a runnable curl,
with its parameters and its response defined, in
[references/13-curl-reference.md](references/13-curl-reference.md): translate the request into
the project's HTTP client and you have the call, whatever the language. There is no code
generator here on purpose — a curl is the same call in every language, where an emitter would
serve six and age with their idioms. [references/11-any-stack.md](references/11-any-stack.md)
specifies the surrounding integration language-neutrally, and reference implementations exist
for TypeScript/Node, Python, Java, Go, PHP and C# as worked examples.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Never hardcode `applicationId` or `password`.** Environment variables only, read through
   one config module, validated at startup. Not in source, not in a client bundle, not in a
   committed file, not in a log, not in git history.
2. **Never call bdapps from client-side code.** Browsers and mobile apps call *your*
   backend; your backend calls bdapps. The credentials are a shared secret and the platform
   enforces IP whitelisting.
3. **Never subscribe or charge without explicit, recorded consent**, and never without
   disclosing amount and frequency first. bdapps suspends applications over this.
4. **Never assume `subscriberId` is a real phone number.** With masking enabled it is an
   opaque hash. Store and send back exactly what you received.
5. **Always make charging idempotent.** One `externalTrxId` per logical charge, persisted
   *before* the call. Never retry with a fresh one — that double-charges a real person.
6. **Never let subscriber identity reach a bdappsAI prompt**, and cap every AI call with
   `max_completion_tokens`. Prompts leave your trust boundary and reach a third-party model
   provider, and an uncapped loop empties a shared prepaid balance.

## Query the API catalog instead of guessing

This repo ships the complete bdapps contract as structured data
([`catalog/bdapps-api.json`](catalog/bdapps-api.json)) plus a zero-dependency CLI over it.
**Run these instead of recalling parameter names** — they are offline, read-only, need no
install, and never see credentials.

```bash
node tools/bdapps.mjs list [category]              # every service and callback
node tools/bdapps.mjs show <id>                    # full contract: params, response, rules
node tools/bdapps.mjs search "<query>"             # find by intent, e.g. "base size"
node tools/bdapps.mjs curl <id> [key=value ...]    # runnable request + param/response defs
node tools/bdapps.mjs validate <id> '<json>'       # check a payload against the spec
node tools/bdapps.mjs code <statusCode>            # decode a status code + the fix
node tools/bdapps.mjs diagnose "<symptom>"         # cause and fix from a symptom
node tools/bdapps.mjs practices [severity]         # security and reliability rules
node tools/bdapps.mjs checklist                    # go-live checklist
node tools/bdapps.mjs reference <doc>              # print a reference document
node tools/bdapps.mjs platform                     # base URLs, operators, conventions
node tools/bdapps.mjs bdappsai [models|errors]     # the bdappsAI gateway: auth, models, errors
node tools/bdapps.mjs sdk                          # the Subscription Charging SDK redirect
```

Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output. If you cannot run commands — or Node
is not installed — read `catalog/bdapps-api.json` directly; it is plain JSON with the same
data. The CLI is a documentation reader, not part of the integration, and constrains nothing
about the stack you build in.

**Use them in this order:** `search` or `list` to find the service → `show` for the exact
contract → the curl reference for the call → `validate` the payload → `code` / `diagnose` when
something fails.

### Write the call from the contract, not from memory

**[references/13-curl-reference.md](references/13-curl-reference.md) is the source for every
call, in every language.** Each endpoint is written out at the wire: a runnable curl, every
parameter defined with type and requiredness, the exact response, every response field
explained, the status codes that endpoint returns — and the same for all four inbound callbacks,
including a command that replays each one against your handler.

Translate the request into the host project's HTTP client and idiom, keeping the payload, the
`statusCode` branching and the benign codes exactly as specified. Body, headers and branching
are identical everywhere, so no language is second-class. `node tools/bdapps.mjs curl <id>
key=value …` prints the same thing for one service with your values filled in and validated.

Run the curl by hand when a call fails: it separates a bad payload from bad code in one step,
and proves credentials, provisioning and the egress IP at once.

**There is no code generator in this skill, by design.** An emitter covers only the languages
someone wrote emitters for and ages with those languages' idioms rather than with the bdapps
contract. Write the client in the project's own conventions from the contract above; the seven
components it belongs in are in [references/11-any-stack.md](references/11-any-stack.md), and
[templates/](templates/README.md) shows them already built in six languages as worked examples
to read — never a reason to add one of those runtimes to a project.

Working reference implementations in [templates/](templates/README.md) for TypeScript/Node,
Python, Java, Go, PHP and C#. Read the one matching the project's stack for shape rather than
inventing a different structure; for any other language, build the same seven components from
the curl reference — and never introduce a new runtime to reach bdapps.

## Service map

One production host for everything, telco and AI alike: `https://developer.bdapps.com`.

**Configure one environment variable per provisioned service**, not one base URL — an
application can only call the APIs it was provisioned for. An unset endpoint means that API is
not enabled, and the client should refuse to call it rather than fail with `E1309` at the
platform. See [templates/.env.example](templates/.env.example).

| Need | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Send SMS (MT) | `POST /sms/send` |
| Broadcast to base | `POST /sms/send` with `destinationAddresses: ["tel:all"]` |
| Receive SMS (MO) | *your callback URL* |
| Delivery report | *your callback URL* |
| USSD screen out | `POST /ussd/send` |
| USSD input in | *your callback URL* |
| Register (opt-in) | `POST /subscription/send` with `action: "1"` |
| **Unregister (opt-out)** | `POST /subscription/send` with `action: "0"` |
| Subscription status | `POST /subscription/getStatus` |
| **Subscriber base size** | `POST /subscription/query-base` |
| Subscription notification | *your callback URL* |
| OTP request / verify | `POST /otp/request`, `POST /otp/verify` |
| Charge a mobile account | `POST /caas/direct/debit` |
| Query balance (needs provisioning) | `POST /caas/get/balance` |
| Consent + charging on a hosted page | `GET https://user.bdapps.com/sdk/subscription/authorize` (signed redirect) |
| **Ask a model / generate text** | `POST https://developer.bdapps.com/bdappsai/api/v1/chat/completions` |
| **Generate an image** | `POST https://developer.bdapps.com/bdappsai/api/v1/images/generations` |

Each of these as a runnable request, with every parameter and response field defined:
[references/13-curl-reference.md](references/13-curl-reference.md).

---

## The universal request/response shape

```
POST {baseUrl}/{path}
Content-Type: application/json

{ "applicationId": "APP_000375", "password": "…", "version": "1.0", …fields… }
```

```json
{ "statusCode": "S1000", "statusDetail": "Success", "version": "1.0" }
```

So: **one `post()` helper that injects credentials, plus thin wrappers per service.** Do not
write bespoke HTTP calls per endpoint, in any language.

**Addressing** — always `tel:`-prefixed, no `+`, no spaces:

```
tel:8801812345678          plain MSISDN
tel:hu3b84346f…          hash key (masking enabled) — opaque
tel:all                  broadcast (SMS only — guard this)
```

Normalise in one helper. Never concatenate `tel:` inline.

## Mistakes to avoid

- ❌ Checking the HTTP status as success (`res.ok`, `raise_for_status()`,
  `EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`, `http_errors`) — **bdapps returns 200 for errors.** Branch on
  `statusCode`.
- ❌ `destinationAddresses: "tel:880…"` — it is always an **array**.
- ❌ Treating `E1351` (already registered) as a failure on Register — it is success.
- ❌ Treating `E1356` (not registered) as a failure on Unregister — it is success.
- ❌ Treating `E1379` (already completed) as a failure on debit — it is success.
- ❌ Retrying a debit with a new `externalTrxId` after a timeout — double charge.
- ❌ Generating your own USSD `sessionId` — echo the platform's.
- ❌ Ending a USSD flow with `mt-cont` — terminal screens use `mt-fin`.
- ❌ An in-process USSD session store (`Map`, `dict`, `HashMap`, package-level `map`) in
  production — breaks across instances.
- ❌ Doing work before acknowledging a callback — sessions time out in seconds. Use the stack's
  real background mechanism, not a bare `await`.
- ❌ Disabled TLS verification in shipped code — `rejectUnauthorized: false`, `verify=False`,
  `InsecureSkipVerify`, `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false`, a trust-all `TrustManager`. Supply
  the intermediate CA instead.
- ❌ `NEXT_PUBLIC_` / `VITE_` / `REACT_APP_` / `PUBLIC_` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_` on any bdapps
  variable, or serving it through a client-facing config endpoint — that ships the password to
  the browser.
- ❌ Standing up a Node sidecar (or any second runtime) to call bdapps from a non-JS project.
- ❌ Logging `password`, the OTP, `referenceNo`, or an unmasked `subscriberId`.
- ❌ Inventing endpoints bdapps does not publish — there is no LBS/location API and no voice/IVR
  API on this platform, and no charging-notification callback in the published contract. If a
  requirement needs one, say so rather than guessing a path.
- ❌ Computing the Charging SDK signature in browser JavaScript — that ships the API Secret.
- ❌ Trusting the Charging SDK's `redirectUrl` return on its own. Match the `requestId` you
  issued, then confirm with `POST /subscription/getStatus`.
- ❌ Sending a bdappsAI key as `Bearer …`, or sending it in the JSON body — it goes in the
  `Authorization` header **verbatim**, `app_<keyId>.<keyValue>`.
- ❌ Looking for `statusCode` in a bdappsAI response, or reusing the telco client for it — bdappsAI
  returns real HTTP status codes and no `S1000`. Keep two clients.
- ❌ Interpolating an MSISDN or a `subscriberId` into a prompt — that sends subscriber identity
  to a third-party model provider.
- ❌ Using a model response without checking `finish_reason` — `length` means it is cut off.
- ❌ Retrying `TOKEN_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` — it is a `429` that will never clear. Alert instead.
- ❌ Calling a model inside a callback's response path — the session dies before it answers.

## When you generate code, always

- Put credentials in `.env` (git-ignored) with a placeholder-only `.env.example`.
- Validate config at startup and fail loudly on missing variables.
- Set an explicit timeout on every call.
- Branch on `statusCode` and map codes to behaviour classes (configuration / client /
  user-state / transient).
- Retry only transient codes and transport errors, with backoff — never a debit with a new ID.
- Make callback handlers acknowledge first, validate the schema, verify `applicationId`, and
  deduplicate.
- Log `requestId` / `sessionId` / `externalTrxId` / `statusCode`; mask subscriber addresses.
- Mirror subscription state locally from notifications instead of polling `getStatus`.
- Use a decimal type for money — `BigDecimal`, `decimal.Decimal`, `decimal`, `bcmath`, a
  decimal library, or integer minor units. Never a binary float.
- Match the host project's existing stack, structure and conventions.

## bdappsAI — the AI gateway

`https://developer.bdapps.com/bdappsai/api` · portal <https://developer.bdapps.com/bdappsai> · full contract
[references/14-bdapps-ai.md](references/14-bdapps-ai.md) · `node tools/bdapps.mjs bdappsai`

**Everything above is inverted here.** Read this table before writing a line of AI code:

| | Telco APIs | bdappsAI |
|---|---|---|
| Credential | `applicationId` + `password` in the **body** | one key in the `Authorization` **header** |
| Key source | bdapps Pro provisioning | the bdappsAI portal — a **different** key |
| Failures | HTTP 200 always; branch on `statusCode` | real HTTP status codes; branch on the status, then `error.code` |
| Success | `statusCode: "S1000"` | HTTP 2xx. There is no `statusCode` field |
| Subject | a subscriber, `tel:88018…` | no subscriber, no MSISDN, no operator |
| Inbound | four callbacks you host | none. bdappsAI never calls you |
| Timeout | 15s | 60–120s |
| Not-provisioned error | `E1309` | `INVALID_LLM_CONFIG` |

**Keep two clients.** One shared HTTP helper applies exactly one of these conventions and is
wrong for half the calls.

**Auth:** `Authorization: app_<keyId>.<keyValue>` — verbatim, including `app_`. Not an OAuth
bearer token: no `Bearer` prefix, no base64. From `BDAPPSAI_API_KEY`, backend only. It spends a
prepaid balance and is **not** IP-whitelisted, so a leak works from anywhere until you rotate it.

| Endpoint | Purpose | Variable |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /bdappsai/api/v1/chat/completions` | chat, on `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-4o-mini` | `BDAPPSAI_CHAT_COMPLETIONS_URL` |
| `POST /bdappsai/api/v1/images/generations` | images, on `gpt-image-1.5` | `BDAPPSAI_IMAGE_GENERATIONS_URL` |

**When you generate bdappsAI code, always:**

- Set `max_completion_tokens` on every chat call and keep `n` at 1 — it is the only ceiling on
  what one request can cost.
- Check `choices[0].finish_reason` before using the content: `length` means it is truncated.
- Branch on `error.code`. The two `429`s differ — `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` clears within the
  minute, `TOKEN_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` never will.
- Retry `429`+`RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (honour `Retry-After`), `500`, `502`, `503` and transport
  errors, capped with jitter. Never retry `400`/`401`/`403`/`404`/`402`. There is no idempotency
  key, so a timed-out call may already have been billed: cap at two attempts.
- Redact before the prompt: no MSISDN, no `subscriberId` (a masked hash is still an identifier),
  no OTP, no credential — not in `messages`, `prompt`, `user`, `safety_identifier` or
  `prompt_cache_key`. Keep `store` false.
- Never call a model inside a callback's response path. Acknowledge with `S1000` first, generate
  out of band, deliver by MT SMS or on the next USSD screen.
- Treat model output as untrusted input: never execute it, never interpolate it into SQL or a
  shell, and length-check it before it becomes an SMS (160 GSM-7 characters per part, 70 for
  Bengali — every part is billed).
- Decode generated images to object storage. The response is base64, never a URL: do not log it
  and do not store it as text.
- Keep model ids in configuration, so a cheaper model can be swapped in without a deploy.
