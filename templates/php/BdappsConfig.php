 * Two credentials, plus one URL per service you provisioned. Nothing else is
 * configuration: timeouts and encodings are constants in the client, because
 * they are properties of the protocol rather than of your deployment.
 *
 * An endpoint that is not set means that API is not enabled on your
 * application. The client refuses to call it, so you get a clear local error
 * instead of E1309 from the platform.
 *
 * Build it once during bootstrap and bind it as a singleton, so a misconfigured
 * deployment fails on the first request rather than deep inside a charge.
 *
 * Laravel: bind this in a service provider and read from config('services.bdapps')
 * so `php artisan config:cache` still works — do NOT call env() outside config files.
 * Never put credentials in a committed .env.example, config file, or Blade view.
 *
 * SERVER-SIDE ONLY.
