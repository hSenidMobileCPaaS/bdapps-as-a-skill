 * configuration: timeouts and encodings are constants in the client, because
 * they are properties of the protocol rather than of your deployment.
 *
 * An endpoint that is not set means that API is not enabled on your
 * application. The client refuses to call it, so you get a clear local error
 * instead of E1309 from the platform.
 *
 * Validation runs at import time, so a misconfigured deployment fails at boot
 * rather than under load.
