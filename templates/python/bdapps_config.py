"""
bdapps configuration — the ONLY module that reads the environment.

Two credentials, plus one URL per service you provisioned. Nothing else is
configuration: timeouts and encodings are constants in the client, because they
are properties of the protocol rather than of your deployment.

An endpoint that is not set means that API is not enabled on your application.
The client refuses to call it, so you get a clear local error instead of E1309
from the platform.

Validation runs at import time, so a misconfigured deployment fails at boot
rather than under load. If your framework defers imports (Django app loading,
Celery workers), call `describe_config()` from your startup hook as well so the
failure surfaces on deploy rather than on first traffic.

SERVER-SIDE ONLY. Nothing here may be exposed through an API response, a
template context, or a settings endpoint the browser can read.
